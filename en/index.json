Introduction Table Of Contents Environment Perception Open Data Civil IoT Taiwan Civil IoT Taiwan Data Service Platform References Environment Perception Human beings are full of curiosity about the changes in the natural world, which can probably trace back to the activities of ancient agricultural civilizations, looking up at the stars and stargazing at night. By the Renaissance in the 16th century AD, Copernicus deduced the “heliocentric theory” based on the existing astronomical data. After Galileo and Newton, it became the origin of modern science. Since modern times, due to the rapid development of semiconductor manufacturing technology, the tools that people use to perceive changes in the living environment have become more and more diverse, sophisticated and miniaturized. In order to catch up with the ever-changing trends of information technology, combined with the real-time perception of sensors and the connection of the Internet, data transmission is getting faster and more popular, and a large amount of observation data is generated, transmitted and archived. In response to massive data, scientists have been working hard to find the laws of environmental changes, explore the relationship between these laws and disasters, and obtain prediction results to improve people’s quality of life, thereby improving the efficiency of disaster prevention and relief, and promoting a more friendly relationship between people and the environment. The goal of creating a beautiful and sustainable living environment has become a significant issue of common concern to individuals, groups, societies and countries in the world today.\nOpen Data “Open data” refers to a type of electronic data (including but not limited to text, data, pictures, videos, sounds, etc.) that is publicly permitted and encouraged to be used by all sectors of society through certain procedures and formats. According to the definition of the Open Knowledge Foundation (https://opendefinition.org/od/2.1/en/), open data must meet the following conditions:\nOpen license or status: The content of the open data must be in the public domain and released with an open license without any additional restrictions. Access: The content of open data must be freely accessible from the Internet, but under reasonable conditions, access to open data may also allow a one-time fee and allow for conditional incidental terms. Machine readability: The content of open data must be easily accessible, processed and modified by computers. Open format: The content of open data must be in an available form, which can be accessed using free or open software. With the prevalence of open trends such as open source code, open government, and open science, open data has gradually become a standard that governments and scientific communities follow when engaging in various policy advocacy and academic research. The recently booming environment-aware IoT has become one of the most anticipated open data projects due to its widespread distribution in the public domain and its observed environmental information being closely related to the public.\nAt present, most of the common open data on the Internet use data formats such as JSON, CSV or XML. The full name of JSON format is Javascript Object Notation, which is a lightweight structured data exchange standard. Its content consists of properties and values, which is easy for computers or users to read and use, and is often used for data presentation, transmission and storage on the website.\nThe full name of the CSV format is Comma-Separated Values. As the name suggests, it is a form of storing table data in plain text, where each data is a column and each attribute in the data is a column. All properties must be stored as plain text in a specific order, with a specific symbol to separate different properties. Commonly used for file import and export of applications, network data transmission, historical data storage, etc.\nThe full name of the XML format is Extensible Markup Language, which is an extensible markup language simplified from the Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML), allowing users to define the required tags. It is often used for the presentation of document file data and the exchange of network data in order to create documents containing structured information.\nCurrently, open data commonly used in Taiwan are aggregated on the following platforms:\nTaiwan government open data platform (https://data.gov.tw/en/) Taiwan open weather data (https://opendata.cwb.gov.tw/devManual/insrtuction) Taiwan EPA open data platform (https://data.epa.gov.tw/en) Civil IoT Taiwan The “Civil IoT Taiwan” project is developed to address the four urgent needs of the public in order to integrate and close to the public services related to people’s livelihood, including air quality, earthquake, water resources, disaster prevention and other issues. In the “Digital Technology” section of the “Forward-looking Infrastructure Development Program” project, the Ministry of Science and Technology, the Ministry of Communications, the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the Ministry of the Interior, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Academia Sinica, and the Council of Agriculture have jointly constructed a large-scale inter-ministerial government project, which applies big data, artificial intelligence, and Internet of things technologies to build various smart life service systems to help the government and the public face the challenges brought about by environmental changes. At the same time, this project also considers the experience of different end-users, including government decision-making units, academia, industry, and the general public. The goal is to enhance intelligent governance, assist the development of industry/academia, and improve the happiness of the public.\nAt present, the four major areas covered by the Civil IoT Taiwan project are:\nWater resources: The Civil IoT Taiwan project cooperates with the water conservancy units of the central and local governments to develop and deploy a variety of water resources sensors, and build various hydrological observation facilities and farmland irrigation water sensors. The goal of this project is to effectively integrate surface, groundwater and emerging water source information and related monitoring information, and to establish a water resource IoT portal and a dynamic analysis and management platform for irrigation water distribution, through big data analysis, so as to strengthen the flood control operation system of each river bureau and establish he sewer cloud management cloud that can perform remote, automated and intelligent management for relevant units at all levels, achieve the goal of combined use, and promote various applications such as intelligent control and management of water sources, dynamic analysis and management of irrigation water distribution, value-added applications of sewage and sewer, and road flood warning. With the opening of data, it will promote the development of water resources data applications and public-private partnership decision-making. Air quality: The Civil IoT Taiwan project, in conjunction with the Environmental Protection Agency, the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the Ministry of Science and Technology, and Academia Sinica, started with the deployment of air quality sensing infrastructure, developed air quality sensors, and established a sensor performance testing and verification center. And a large number of air quality sensors for different purposes are widely distributed throughout Taiwan. Through the collection of a large amount of sensing data at smaller time and space scales, this project establishes a computing operation platform for the Internet of Things and a smart environment sensing data center, and builds a visualization platform for air quality sensing data. On the one hand, it promotes the development of the Internet of Things for air quality sensing, and on the other hand, it provides high-resolution evidence data for intelligent environmental protection inspections to identify polluted hot spots and effectively conduct environmental governance. At the same time, the project also strengthens the research and development capacity of domestic own technology during the plan period, and establishes the development of domestic independent airborne product sensing technology. Earthquakes: The Civil IoT Taiwan project also significantly increases the number of on-site earthquake quick-reporting stations to provide high-density, high-quality earthquake quick-reporting information for the common seismic activity in Taiwan. At the same time, seismic and geophysical observatories were added and upgraded to improve the quality and resolution of observational data, including Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) stations, underground seismic stations, strong earthquake stations, geomagnetic stations, and groundwater stations. In addition, the project is enhancing its GNSS stations, underground seismic stations, and drone observations for regional monitoring of the Datun Volcano. In view of Taiwan’s unique island characteristics, it has also strengthened its forecasting capabilities for strong earthquakes and tsunamis, and expanded submarine optical cables and related submarine and land stations. In addition, through the integration and application of big data, the project has constructed an integrated data management system for Taiwan’s seismic and geophysical data, which can facilitate the integration of local and regional earthquake quick report information, strengthen the monitoring of Taiwan’s fault areas and the Datun volcanic area, and provide fast and complete earthquake quick report information transmission, thereby providing the public with real-time early warning of strong earthquakes and promoting the development of the earthquake disaster prevention industry. Disaster prevention and relief: The Civil IoT Taiwan project gathers a total of 58 types of warning data covering air, water, land, disaster and people’s livelihood into a single “Civil Alert Information Platform” to provide the public with real-time disaster prevention and relief information. Moreover, incorporating the emergency management information cloud system (EMIC2.0) and other decision-making assisting systems, the platform provides disaster prevention personnel with various disaster situations, notifications and disaster relief resources to assist in various decision-making work, and at the same time, the relevant historical data is collected and released in a unified data format, which is made available for disaster prevention industry to analyze and use, and promote the development of disaster information industry chain. Civil IoT Taiwan Data Service Platform In addition, the Civil IoT Taiwan project also plans the Civil IoT Taiwan data service platform to accommodate various data generated by the Civil IoT Taiwan project and provide stable and high-quality sensing data for various environmental management purposes. In the spirit of open data, the platform adopts a unified data format, provides real-time data interfaces and historical data query services, improves user browsing and search speed, and sets up sensor data storage mechanisms to help scientific computing and artificial intelligence applications. The establishment of the Civil IoT Taiwan data service platform can not only narrow the gap in environmental information, but also provide more real-time and comprehensive environmental data, allowing the public to view perception information and temporal and spatial changes in real time, and to understand the living environment at any time. The data provided by the platform can also be used as a basis for industrial value-added, thereby stimulating the creativity of the people and providing high-quality services for solving the problems of the people.\nCurrently, the Civil IoT Taiwan Data Service Platform uses the open data format of the OGC SensorThings API.

The project also designed a series of training materials and business coaching, from the establishment and development of the team, from the inception to the formation of the idea, and from the conception to the implementation of the application service. After several years of accumulation, the project has successfully developed a successful case, which shows that the Civil IoT Taiwan project is not only a hardware construction for government units, but also has successfully transformed into a basic information construction for people’s livelihood. The project is providing a steady stream of high-quality sensor data for improving people’s lives and promoting more innovative, convenient, and caring information services.\nFor examples of applications and solutions in various fields of Civil IoT Taiwan data, please refer to the following website resources:\nCivil IoT Taiwan Service and Solution Guide: Water resources Civil IoT Taiwan Service and Solution Guide: Air qualuty Civil IoT Taiwan Service and Solution Guide: Earthquake Civil IoT Taiwan Service and Solution Guide: Disaster prevention and relief References Open Definition: defining open in open data, open content and open knowledge.

    "content": "This set of materials includes seven themes including “Introduction”, “Overview of the Materials”, “Data Access Method”, “Data Analysis in Time Dimension”, “Data Analysis in Space Dimension”, “Data Applications” and “System Applications”. The major themes are described as follows:\nIntroduction: We introduce the core of the entire project - “Civil IoT Taiwan Project”, including various achievements of the project in the past few years, as well as its open data, covering water resources, air quality, earthquakes, and disaster prevention and relief fields, which can bring daily life various applications and services in. We also present various existing materials, videos and successful cases, so that everyone can deeply understand the importance of “Civil IoT Taiwan project” to people’s livelihood.\nOverview of the Materials: We present the structure of the entire material, as well as the Python programming language and Google Colab platform used in the material. Through simple text descriptions, we guide readers to quickly understand the structure of the entire material, and provides a rich list of external resources for those who are interested and in need to further explore related technologies.\nData Access Method: We introduce how to use simple Python syntax to directly access the data of the Civil IoT Taiwan Data Service Platform through the pyCIOT tool we developed, and cut out two units for a more in-depth introduction according to different needs:\nBasic Data Access Method: We introduce how to obtain the latest sensing data of a single station for different aspects of water resources, air quality, earthquake, and disaster information in the Civil IoT Taiwan Data Service Platform for people’s livelihood, as well as how to obtain a list of all stations, and the latest current data of all stations. Specific Spatio-temporal Data Access Method: We introduce how to obtain the data of a certain station at a specific time or time range, find the latest current data of the nearest station, and find the current latest data of all stations around the given coordinates from the Civil IoT Taiwan Data Service Platform. In addition to introducing data access methods, we also intersperse with basic exploratory data analysis (EDA) methods, use commonly used statistical methods to describe the data characteristics of different aspects of the data, and draw simple diagrams to let readers learn by doing, and experience what it’s like to analyze data firsthand.\nData Analysis in Time Dimension: In view of the time series characteristics of IoT data, we design three topics to demonstrate time-series data analysis using Civil IoT Taiwan data.\nTime Series Data Processing: We use the sensing data of Civil IoT Taiwan Data Platform to guide readers to understand the use of moving averages, perform periodic analysis on time series data, and then disassemble the time series data into long-term trends, seasonal changes, periodic changes, and random fluctuations. At the same time, change point detection and outlier detection techniques are applied to check the existing Civil IoT Taiwan Data by applying the existing Python packages, and the possible meanings behind the detection results are discussed. Time Series Data Forecast: We use sensory data from the Civil IoT Taiwan Data Platform and apply existing Python data science packages (such as scikit-learn, Kats, etc.) to compare different data prediction methods in a hands-on fashion. Combine the forecast results, we present the data in a graph, and discuss the implications behind the forecast results for different datasets and temporal resolutions. Then, we also discuss possible derivative applications. Time Series Data Clustering: We introduce more advanced data clustering analysis. We first introduce two time series feature extraction methods, namely Fourier transform and wavelet transform, and briefly explain the difference between the two transform methods. We then introduce two distance functions for time series data, Euclidean distance and Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) distance, and apply existing clustering packages using these two functions. Finally, we discuss the implications behind clustering results using different datasets and different temporal resolutions in real-world applications, as well as possible derived applications. Data Analysis in Space Dimension: Given the geospatial characteristics of Civil IoT Taiwan data, we introduce a series of spatial data analysis methods according to different needs and applications.\nGeospatial Filtering: We use the earthquake and disaster prevention and relief data of the Civil IoT Taiwan Data Platform, superimpose the administrative region boundary map data obtained from the government’s open data platform, and generate a picture file of geospatial data distribution after generating the overlay map. Additionally, we demonstrate how to nest specific regions of geometric topology, output the nested results to a file, and perform drawing operations. Geospatial Analysis: We use sensing data from Civil IoT Taiwan Data Platform to introduce more advanced geospatial analysis. Using the GPS location coordinates of the sensors, we first use an existing Python package to find the largest convex polygon (Convex Hull) to frame the geographic area covered by the sensors; then we apply the Voronoi Diagram algorithm to cut the area on the map based on the distribution of the sensors, cutting out the sphere of influence of each sensor. For the area between the sensors, we apply different spatial interpolation algorithms, fill the values on the spatial map according to the sensor values, and produce the corresponding image output. Data Applications: In this topic, we will focus on the derivative applications after accessing the Civil IoT Taiwan data platform, and by importing other library suites and analysis algorithms, we will enhance the value and application services of Civil IoT Taiwan’s open data. We will develop the following three subtopics in turn:\nA First Look at Machine Learning: We use air quality and water level category data, combined with weather observations, to perform predictive analysis of sensory values using machine learning packages. We demonstrate the standard process of machine learning, and describe how to evaluate the effectiveness of predictive analytics, and how to avoid the bias and overfitting problems that machine learning is prone to. Anomaly Detection: We use air quality category data to demonstrate sensor anomaly detection algorithms commonly used in Taiwanese micro air quality sensing data. In a learning-by-doing way, including data preparation, feature extraction, data analysis, statistics, and induction, the principle and implementation process of anomaly detection algorithms are reproduced step by step, allowing readers to experience how to superimpose basic data analysis and machine learning to achieve advanced and practical data application service. Dynamic Calibration Model: We use air quality category data to demonstrate the dynamic calibration algorithm for Taiwanese micro air quality sensors and official stations. In the way of learning by doing, including data preparation, feature extraction, machine learning, data analysis, statistics, etc., it reproduces the principle and implementation process of the sensor dynamic calibration model algorithm, allowing readers to experience how to gradually realize advanced and basic data analysis by overlaying and machine learning steps to provide practical data application services. System Applications: This topic focuses on the integration and application of Civil IoT Taiwan open data and other application software, and further deepens and exerts the value of Civil IoT Taiwan open data through the professional functions of other application software. Units we develop include:\nQGIS Applications: QGIS is a free and open-source GIS software. With this software, users can organize, analyze and draw different geospatial data and thematic maps, presenting the distribution and information types of geographical phenomena. We use QGIS to process Civil IoT Taiwan data, including water, air quality, earthquake, and disaster prevention and relief categories; and overlay different information by clicking and dragging to perform as described in the “Geospatial Filtering” and “Geospatial Analysis” topics. We also discuss the pros and cons of QGIS software and when to use it. Tableau Applications: Tableau is an easy-to-use, powerful data visualization software that can easily connect databases and data files in various formats to create various beautiful statistical charts. We demonstrate how to use drag-and-drop to import data from four aspects of Civil IoT Taiwan, including water resources, air quality, earthquakes, and disaster prevention and relief categories, and make simple charts to compare numerical data. Geospatial data is also overlaid on the map, and time-series data is presented in the form of graphs that show trends in values. In addition, through the interface of external data sources, we can integrate datasets from multiple different sources into a single map to generate beautiful reports in a very short time. Leafmap Applications: Leafmap is a Python development toolkit deeply integrated with Google Earth Engine to directly manipulate and visualize analysis results on platforms such as Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook. We demonstrate the use of leafmap to process Civil IoT Taiwan data, including categories such as water resources, air quality, earthquake, disaster prevention and relief, and build a simple GIS system combined with Google Earth Engine’s rich satellite imagery. At the same time, Streamlit is a tool for Python users to quickly build a web application framework. We demonstrate the integration of leafmap application and Streamlit to form a web version of GIS information service, which expands readers’ imagination space for data analysis and future information services.

    "content": " Table Of Contents Programming Language - Python Development Platform – Google Colab References Programming Language - Python The subject of this material is the data application of Civil IoT Taiwan. This set of articles will use Python, a programming language commonly used in the data science community, as the main programming language, and adopt an easy-to-understand demonstration method to guide you to read while doing it, step-by-step into the content of each chapter of the topic, and obtain first-hand experience with Civil IoT Taiwan data applications, and the ability to draw inferences from other data science topics in the future.\nOverall, the Python programming language quickly became the most popular programming language in the data science community in a short period of time, mainly due to the following three advantages:\nLower barriers to learning: Compared with other text-based programming languages (such as C and Java), the Python language has fewer special symbols, and literally looks closer to the common English articles in daily life. If you master Python syntax and program execution logic, coupled with the ability of English words, it is easy to understand the semantics of Python code, so the threshold for learning Python is very low! A wide variety of libraries: After more than 30 years of development, the Python language has grown into an ecosystem. In addition to the basic syntax, various packages can be added, which can be advanced and transformed into various tools, suitable for solving various problems. By customizing a Python toolkit (pyCIOT) in this project, the ceiling of learning can be raised faster, so as to understand how to more conveniently apply Civil IoT Taiwan data. More suitable for self-study: With Kit, code reading comprehension is more important than code writing ability! If you want to control an existing kit, you have to understand the manuals, then line them up and piece together the code that solves the problem. Therefore, the problem-solving mode will be “stacking programs on the basis of existing program masters, rather than writing Python code from scratch”; especially the development of code reading and comprehension skills, it is more suitable to use the self-learning mode. After you are familiar with the logic of Python, learning to read code will have the opportunity to be as fun as reading a storybook. Due to the above advantages of the Python language, the Python language has become the most commonly used programming language in data science and the first programming language used by many programming learners. Therefore, in addition to various Python language teaching books on the market, many practical learning resources can also be found online. It is worth further exploration and learning for readers interested in the Python language.\nFree Courses Python for Everybody Specialization, Coursera (https://www.coursera.org/specializations/python) Python for Data Science, AI \u0026 Development, Coursera (https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-for-applied-data-science-ai) Introduction to Python Programming, Udemy (https://www.udemy.com/course/pythonforbeginnersintro/) Learn Python for Total Beginners, Udemy (https://www.udemy.com/course/python-3-for-total-beginners/) Google’s Python Class (https://developers.google.com/edu/python) Introduction to Python, Microsoft (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/intro-to-python/) Learn Python 3 from Scratch, Educative (https://www.educative.io/courses/learn-python-3-from-scratch) Free e-Book Non-Programmer’s Tutorial for Python 3, Josh Cogliati (https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Non-Programmer’s_Tutorial_for_Python_3) Python 101, Michael Driscoll (https://python101.pythonlibrary.org/) The Python Coding Book, Stephen Gruppetta (https://thepythoncodingbook.com/) Python Data Science Handbook, Jake VanderPlas (https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/) Intro to Machine Learning with Python, Bernd Klein (https://python-course.eu/machine-learning/) Applied Data Science, Ian Langmore and Daniel Krasner (https://columbia-applied-data-science.github.io/) Development Platform – Google Colab Unlike C language, which can be compiled into executable files in advance, Python itself is an interpreted language, that is, it is translated into machine language for computer execution before execution. In other words, it is a literal translation when executed, in situations similar to everyday life. In this way, it is as if translators are helping us to translate and communicate in a language acceptable to foreigners. When we speak a sentence, the translator directly helps us translate the sentence. On the contrary, when the foreigner speaks, the staff will help us translate the foreigner’s words so that we can understand.\nDue to this feature of the interpreted language, in addition to the program editor officially provided by Python, there are many other editors with different functions. Based on the similarity between Python code and natural language, some people have proposed to make the Python editor into a notebook-like mode, an editor that can mix natural language articles and Python code on one page, the most famous of which is Jupyter.\nOn the basis of Jupyter, Google moved the Python interpretation language to the Internet cloud. As long as you apply for a Google account, you can install the free Colab application on Google Drive, and use the browser directly to enjoy the Python program editing function. Due to its simplicity and rich functionality, it has become the most used development platform for Python users.\nOverall, Google Colab has four major advantages:\nPre-installed packages: The Google Colab development platform has pre-installed most of the Python packages, and users can use them directly, avoiding their own installation, and even eliminating the problem of version conflicts caused by different packages during the installation process, greatly reducing the entry threshold for using Python to develop programs. Cloud storage: With Google’s own cloud storage space, Google Colab can store program notes during development in the cloud space. As long as it is accessed through the network, it can be seamlessly connected even on different computers, solving the problems of data storage, backup and portability. Collaboration：Google Colab provides network sharing and online collaboration features, allowing users to share program notes with other users through cloud storage, and allowing users to invite other users to browse, annotate, and even edit their own program notes, speeding up team collaboration . Free GPU and TPU resources: With Google’s own rich cloud computing resources, Google Colab provides GPU and TPU processors, allowing users to use high-end processors to execute their own personal program notes, which is conducive to large-capacity program development needs.
