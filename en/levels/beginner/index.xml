      <description>1. Introduction Table Of Contents Environment Perception Open Data Civil IoT Taiwan Civil IoT Taiwan Data Service Platform References Environment Perception Human beings are full of curiosity about the changes in the natural world, which can probably trace back to the activities of ancient agricultural civilizations, looking up at the stars and stargazing at night. By the Renaissance in the 16th century AD, Copernicus deduced the &amp;ldquo;heliocentric theory&amp;rdquo; based on the existing astronomical data.</description>

      <description>4. Time Series Data Analysis In this topic, we will introduce time series data analysis methods for IoT data. We will develop the following three units for a more in-depth exploration by using the Civil IoT Taiwan Data Service Platform.
4.1. Time Series Data ProcessingWe use the sensing data of Civil IoT Taiwan Data Service Platform to guide readers to understand the use of moving average, perform periodic analysis of time series data, and then disassemble the time series data into long-term trends, seasonal changes and residual fluctuations.</description>
