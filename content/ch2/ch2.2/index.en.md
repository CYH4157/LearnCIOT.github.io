## Programming Language - Python

The subject of this material is the data application of Civil IoT Taiwan. The articles will use Python, a programming language commonly used in the data science community, as the primary programming language and adopt an easy-to-understand demonstration approach to guide readers step-by-step into the content. The readers can obtain first-hand experience with Civil IoT Taiwan data applications and become able to draw inferences from other data science topics in the future.

Overall, the Python programming language quickly became the most popular programming language in the data science community in a short period, mainly due to the following three advantages:

- Lower barriers to learning: Compared with other text-based programming languages (such as C and Java), Python has fewer special symbols and looks closer to the typical English articles in daily life. Suppose you master Python syntax and program execution logic, coupled with the ability of English words. In that case, it is easy to understand the semantics of Python code, so the threshold for learning Python is very low!
- A wide variety of libraries: After more than 30 years of development, the Python language has grown into an ecosystem. In addition to the basic syntax, various packages can be added, which can be advanced and transformed into multiple tools suitable for solving different problems. By customizing a Python toolkit (pyCIOT) in this project, the learning ceiling can be raised faster to understand how to more conveniently apply Civil IoT Taiwan data.
- More suitable for self-study: With Kit, code reading comprehension is more important than code writing ability! If you want to control an existing kit, you must understand the manuals, line them up and piece together the code that solves the problem. Therefore, problem-solving will be "stacking programs based on existing program masters, rather than writing Python code from scratch." Consequently, it is more suitable to use the self-learning mode to develop code reading and comprehension skills. After you are familiar with the logic of Python, learning to read code will have the opportunity to be as fun as reading a storybook.

Due to the above advantages of the Python language, the Python language has become the most commonly used programming language in data science and the first programming language used by many programming learners. Therefore, in addition to various Python language teaching books on the market, many practical learning resources can also be found online. It is worth further exploration and learning for readers interested in Python.

## Development Platform **– Google Colab**

Unlike C language, which can be compiled into executable files in advance, Python itself is an interpreted language, that is, it is translated into machine language for computer execution before execution. In other words, it is a literal translation when executed, in situations similar to everyday life. In this way, it is as if translators are helping us to translate and communicate in a language acceptable to foreigners. When we speak a sentence, the translator directly helps us translate the sentence. On the contrary, when the foreigner speaks, the staff will help us translate the foreigner's words so that we can understand.

Due to this feature of the interpreted language, in addition to the program editor officially provided by Python, many other editors have different functions. Based on the similarity between Python code and natural language, some people have proposed making the Python editor into a notebook-like mode, an editor that can mix natural language articles and Python code on one page, the most famous of which is Jupyter.

Based on Jupyter, Google moved the Python interpretation language to the Internet cloud. If you apply for a Google account, you can install the free Colab application on Google Drive and use the browser directly to enjoy the Python program editing function. Due to its simplicity and rich functionality, it has become the most used development platform for Python users.

Overall, Google Colab has four significant advantages:

- Pre-installed packages: The Google Colab development platform has pre-installed most of the Python packages, and users can use them directly, avoiding their installation and even eliminating the problem of version conflicts caused by different packages during the installation process, significantly reducing the entry threshold for using Python to develop programs.
- Cloud storage: With Google's own cloud storage space, Google Colab can store program notes during development in the cloud space. As long as it is accessed through the network, it can be seamlessly connected even on different computers, solving the problems of data storage, backup, and portability.
- Collaboration: Google Colab provides network sharing and online collaboration features, allowing users to share program notes with other users through cloud storage, and allowing users to invite other users to browse, annotate, and even edit their program notes, speeding up team collaboration.
- Free GPU and TPU resources: With Google's rich cloud computing resources, Google Colab provides GPU and TPU processors, allowing users to use high-end processors to execute their personal program notes, which is conducive to large-capacity program development needs.
