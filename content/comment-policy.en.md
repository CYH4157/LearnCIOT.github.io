title: "Comment Policy"
chapter: true
---


We love comments on our articles and would love to hear what you have to say respectfully. Remember to:

- Friendly, polite and relevant;
- No profanity, abusive, personal attacks or inappropriate content;
- If you harass people or make fun of tragedies, you will be blocked;
- No spam posts or posts trying to sell anything.

The main rule here is simple: treat others with respect for yourself. Trolling and posting inappropriate content can get you banned, and we don't want that.

Our moderators do their best not to delete comments, and we believe that communities have individual, and often strong, opinions and perspectives. However, we reserve the right to remove comments for the above reasons as well as for the following reasons:

- Any violation of our Privacy Policy;
- Anything that is derogatory and/or derogatory in any perceivable way based on race, religion, colour, national origin, disability, sexual orientation;
- Any other comments that are harmful to the community.

Our moderators try to catch inappropriate content, but we also want our community to help us police it. If you see an inappropriate comment, you can report it to us by clicking on the banner. We will review comments and decide whether to keep or delete them.

### Canâ€™t find your comment on the site?

- Occasionally we experience technical difficulties and your comment may not appear on our site.
- We may not have approved it because it violates one of the above rules.
- We may have removed it because it violated our commenting guidelines.

### Why am I blocked from commenting?

While we do our best to allow everyone to have an opinion in our online communities, sometimes commenters cross the line. From time to time, we block and ban commenters who violate our rules. Blockers use a variety of techniques and information to perform blocking, including emails, IP addresses, and any other information available.
This prevents abusive commenters from posting comments on the site in the future, even if future or other comments are not abusive. Depending on the software we are using at the time, the ban could also cause other previous comments from the abuser to disappear.
